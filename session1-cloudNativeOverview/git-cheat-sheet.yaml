GIT Cheat Sheet

Try this to get started with:

1.	Log into https://gitlab.eng.vmware.com/ with your vmware account
2.	Create an SSH key
a.	Top right profile icon  Settings  SSH Keys
b.	Create an rsa key and copy .pub to the gitlab
3.	Go to https://gitlab.eng.vmware.com/atauber/tam-modern-apps
4.	Copy the Clone command for SSH
5.	Go to the command line and create a holding directory, cd to it
6.	Command: “git clone <copied clone string>”


From here, you add/edit files in the directory.

Common git commands (must be in the git directory to issue):

Synch up with what is at gitlab.eng.vmware.com: git pull
List which branch you are currently in: git branch
Switch branch (currently we only have master but we can create more): git checkout <branch>

Push your local content to gitlab.eng.vmware.com:
                Mark files to add (mind the dot): git add .
                Add comment for commit: git commit -m “comment here”
                Push updates: git push
You should now see updated content in browser.

There also is the concept of merging code for multiple users.  You could create a new branch – say “dev” – in the UI.  Switch to that branch locally and make edits and push up.  Then in UI, you can merge those changes from dev to master.
